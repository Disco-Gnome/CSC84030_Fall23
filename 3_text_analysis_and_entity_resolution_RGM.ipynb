Our terms with the same meaning include, \"entity disambiguation/linking\", duplicate detection\", \"deduplication\", \"record matching\", \"(reference) reconciliation\", \"object identification\", \"data/information integration\", and \"conflation\".\n",
        "#### Entity Resolution (ER) refers to the task of finding records in a dataset that refer to the same entity across different data sources (e.g., data files, books, websites, databases). ER is necessary when joining datasets based on entities that may or may not share a common identifier (e.g., database key, URI, National identification number), as may be the case due to differences in record shape, storage location, and/or curator style or preference. A dataset that has undergone ER may be referred to as being cross-linked.\n",

        "#### A simple approach to entity resolution is to treat all records as strings and compute their similarity with a string distance function. In this part, we will build some components for performing bag-of-words text-analysis, and then use them to compute record similarity.\n",
        "#### [Bag-of-words][bag-of-words] is a conceptually simple yet powerful approach to text analysis.\n",
        "#### The idea is to treat strings, a.k.a. **documents**, as *unordered collections* of words, or **tokens**, i.e., as bags of words.\n",
        "> #### **Note on terminology**: a \"token\" is the result of parsing the document down to the elements we consider \"atomic\" for the task at hand.  Tokens can be things like words, numbers, acronyms, or other exotica like word-roots or fixed-length character strings.\n",
        "> #### Bag of words techniques all apply to any sort of token, so when we say \"bag-of-words\" we really mean \"bag-of-tokens,\" strictly speaking.\n",
        "#### Tokens become the atomic unit of text comparison. If we want to compare two documents, we count how many tokens they share in common. If we want to search for documents with keyword queries (this is what Google does), then we turn the keywords into tokens and find documents that contain them. The power of this approach is that it makes string comparisons insensitive to small differences that probably do not affect meaning much, for example, punctuation and word order.\n",

can occur thereby removing potential known and unknown security risks that threaten enterprise networks and applications. because the cisco security agent analyzes behavior rather than relying on signature matching its solution provides robust protection with reduced operational costs. as recent high-visibility attacks like code red and the sql slammer worm have shown traditional technologies are limited in their abilities to combat the effects of new and evolving attacks. customers require host security that protects throughout all stages of an attack and provides important protection against new and unknown threats. assaults on network systems typically go through stages. cisco recognizes that only a layered approach is effective against security breaches that can occur at any stage from beyond the perimeter to the server or at the file level. the cisco security agent proactively defends against damage to a host throughout all stages of the attack whereas other technologies provide early-stage protection and only then when a signature is known. the cisco security agent is specifically designed to protect against new attacks where there is no known signature. the cisco security agent consists of a management console resident on a server and host-based agents that are deployed on mission-critical desktops and servers. the agents use the http and secure sockets layer

With weights, when we compare documents, instead of counting common tokens, we sum up the weights of common tokens. A good heuristic for assigning weights is called \"Term-Frequency/Inverse-Document-Frequency,\" or [TF-IDF][tfidf] for short.\n",
        "#### **TF**\n",
        "#### TF rewards tokens that appear many times in the same document. It is computed as the frequency of a token in a document, that is, if document *d* contains 100 tokens and token *t* appears in *d* 5 times, then the TF weight of *t* in *d* is *5/100 = 1/20*. The intuition for TF is that if a word occurs often in a document, then it is more important to the meaning of the document.\n",
        "#### **IDF**\n",
        "#### IDF rewards tokens that are rare overall in a dataset. The intuition is that it is more significant if two documents share a rare word than a common one. IDF weight for a token, *t*, in a set of documents, *U*, is computed as follows:\n",

        "* #### Find *n(t)*, the number of documents in *U* that contain *t*\n",

        "#### Note that *n(t)/N* is the frequency of *t* in *U*, and *N/n(t)* is the inverse frequency.\n",
        "> #### **Note on terminology**: Sometimes token weights depend on the document the token belongs to, that is, the same token may have a different weight when it's found in different documents.  We call these weights *local* weights.  TF is an example of a local weight, because it depends on the length of the source.  On the other hand, some token weights only depend on the token, and are the same everywhere that token is found.  We call these weights *global*, and IDF is one such weight.\n",

To do this, we need to extract the record for the token from the tokenized small Amazon dataset and we need to convert the IDFs for the small dataset into a Python dictionary. We can do the first part, by using a `filter()` transformation to extract the matching record and a `collect()` action to return the value to the driver. For the second part, we use the [`collectAsMap()` action](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.RDD.collectAsMap) to return the IDFs to the driver as a Python dictionary."

We will treat each document as a vector in some high dimensional space. Then, to compare two documents we compute the cosine of the angle between their two document vectors. This is *much* easier than it sounds.\n",

We treat each unique token as a dimension, and treat token weights as magnitudes in their respective token dimensions. For example, suppose we use simple counts as weights, and we want to interpret the string \"Hello, world!  Goodbye, world!\" as a vector. Then in the \"hello\" and \"goodbye\" dimensions the vector has value 1, in the \"world\" dimension it has value 2, and it is zero in all other dimensions.\n",
        "#### The next question is: given two vectors how do we find the cosine of the angle between them? Recall the formula for the dot product of two vectors:\n",
        "#### $$ a \\cdot b = \\| a \\| \\| b \\| \\cos \\theta $$\n",
        "#### Here $ a \\cdot b = \\sum a_i b_i $ is the ordinary dot product of two vectors, and $ \\|a\\| = \\sqrt{ \\sum a_i^2 } $ is the norm of $ a $.\n",
        "#### We can rearrange terms and solve for the cosine to find it is simply the normalized dot product of the vectors. With our vector model, the dot product and norm computations are simple functions of the bag-of-words document representations, so we now have a formal way to compute similarity:\n",
        "#### $$ similarity = \\cos \\theta = \\frac{a \\cdot b}{\\|a\\| \\|b\\|} = \\frac{\\sum a_i b_i}{\\sqrt{\\sum a_i^2} \\sqrt{\\sum b_i^2}} $$\n",
        "#### Setting aside the algebra, the geometric interpretation is more intuitive. The angle between two document vectors is small if they share many tokens in common, because they are pointing in roughly the same direction. For that case, the cosine of the angle will be large. Otherwise, if the angle is large (and they have few words in common), the cosine is small. Therefore, cosine similarity scales proportionally with our intuitive sense of similarity.\n",

In this part, we will implement a more scalable algorithm and use it to do entity resolution on the full dataset.\n",

        "#### To improve our ER algorithm from the earlier parts, we should begin by analyzing its running time. In particular, the algorithm above is quadratic in two ways. First, we did a lot of redundant computation of tokens and weights, since each record was reprocessed every time it was compared. Second, we made quadratically many token comparisons between records.\n",
        "#### The first source of quadratic overhead can be eliminated with precomputation and look-up tables, but the second source is a little more tricky. In the worst case, every token in every record in one dataset exists in every record in the other dataset, and therefore every token makes a non-zero contribution to the cosine similarity. In this case, token comparison is unavoidably quadratic.\n",
        "#### But in reality most records have nothing (or very little) in common. Moreover, it is typical for a record in one dataset to have at most one duplicate record in the other dataset (this is the case assuming each dataset has been de-duplicated against itself). In this case, the output is linear in the size of the input and we can hope to achieve linear running time.\n",
        "#### An [**inverted index**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index) is a data structure that will allow us to avoid making quadratically many token comparisons.  It maps each token in the dataset to the list of documents that contain the token.  So, instead of comparing, record by record, each token to every other token to see if they match, we will use inverted indices to *look up* records that match on a particular token.\n",
